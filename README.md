# Javascript (ES6+)
I've created this repository to practice all new ECMAScript 6+ features.
The exercises are separated by category.

This exercises are from Eve Porcello course [Learning ECMAScript 6+ (ES6+)](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/certificates/68da42bede7b2c75a3b093535f4f91ee8b4599d2824ad79840e7a82c5a516199).
